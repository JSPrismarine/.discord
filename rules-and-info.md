**__```AvalanchePowered Community Discord```__**
Welcome to the AvalanchePowered Discord Guild, here you can talk about and get support for any projects managed under the AvalanchePowered GitHub organization, thanks for joining us on our journey! üëã

**__```Discord Guild Rules```__**
We have Discord server rules in place to ensure everybody has a good time here whilst also keeping the server clean for anybody looking to get help.

> 1Ô∏è‚É£ **No self-promotion.**
Do not self-promote anything outside any of the dedicated advertising Discord Channels.

> 2Ô∏è‚É£ **No direct sharing of plugins.**
This rule is put in place to prevent users from attempting to spread malicious plugins.

> 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep toxicity out.**
People come here to talk about and get help for all things Avalanche, not to feel unwelcomed by the server members.

> 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Be a civilized person**
Please do not act like a total degenerate in this server, we will not tolerate this.

> 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Do not flood chat.**
Instead of sending multiple short messages, please send one single long message instead when asking for help.

> 6Ô∏è‚É£ **No NSFW/NSFL content.**
This content is not allowed in this server, please keep it away from here.

> 7Ô∏è‚É£ **In general, don't be stupid.**
Use common sense before doing anything, keep in mind we can punish you even if you didn't technically break the rules if we believe you did something unacceptable.

These rules were last updated on `Wednesday, 11th May, 2022`.
